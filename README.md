![Computer Garden](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0156/0137/files/Recycled-Computer-Monitor-Garden.jpg?v=1488199327)

For my personal development, I wanted to learn some a new stack:

Backend:
- Spring Boot (Already well known)
- Kotlin
- GraphQL

Frontend:
- React JS (Revist, as I used this a long time ago)
- Typescript (Also as a refresher)
- Next JS

In this project I will create a Garden Tracker to keep track of a "Moestuintje" 🧑‍🌾.
For an up to date overview of the project's status, see: https://github.com/users/Kwieto/projects/1
